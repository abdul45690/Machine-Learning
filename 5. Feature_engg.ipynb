    "# Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "Nominal encoding is a technique that assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable. This technique is useful when there is an inherent ordering or hierarchy in the categorical data. For example, in a variable that describes education level, there may be an inherent ordering of the categories (e.g., elementary school < high school < college). In such cases, nominal encoding can assign values that reflect this ordering.\n",

    "# Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the number of unique values in a categorical variable is large. One-hot encoding can result in a large number of columns, which can be computationally expensive and may lead to overfitting, especially when working with limited data. In such cases, nominal encoding can be a more efficient and effective way of encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset with a categorical variable called \"City\" that lists the names of different cities. If we use one-hot encoding on this variable, we will end up with a column for each unique city name, which could lead to a large number of columns. Instead, we can use nominal encoding to encode each city name with a unique integer value. This will reduce the number of columns and help improve the efficiency of the model.\n"

    "For a dataset with 5 unique categorical values, one-hot encoding is a suitable choice. One-hot encoding involves creating a binary vector for each unique category, with a value of 1 indicating the presence of that category and 0 indicating its absence. This technique is preferred for a small number of unique categories as it does not result in a large number of new features, which could lead to the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, one-hot encoding is suitable for algorithms that can handle high dimensional feature spaces, such as decision trees and deep learning models.\n"
